___project description___
In this project we are creating a clone of the AirBnB website from scratch.

___Description of the command interpreter___
We are going to start with creating a command interpreter that will help us manage all our code.
To start the interpreter, type ./console.py and hit enter.

How to use it?
	- After opening it, type help and hit enter. The interprater will list all the available commands.
	- Type "help <"command name">" to get more information about the command.
	- To use a command, type it followed by its arguments.

Usage example:

Lets assume we have a command (a class method) named greet that takes a user name as an argument and prints "hi <"user name">"
step one: ./console.py
(cmd) 

step two: (cmd) <tab> <tab>
help greet ...other commands

step three: (cmd) help greet
-displays the documentation of the greet method

step four: (cmd) greet Anthony
hi, Anthony
